## Chitz - Chat App

[Test Here](https://chitz.herokuapp.com)

This app was a quick little project that made as an attempt to become more familiar with Socket.io

To use it, enter your name, and a room.  All active users in a room can message each other.  But they lose all messages when they disconnect.  Kind of like Snapchats messenger.
